# Hello Github page

This is the page for the materials for [my talk](http://riotscience.co.uk/tribe-events/data-visualisation-in-r-by-dr-niklas-johannes/) at the RIOTS science club in Durham on Friday, 2021-03-19.
The talk is a very basic introduction to data visualization with `ggplot2` for those either new to R or new to `ggplot2`.

You can [view the slides here](/intro_ggplot2_slides.html). The source code for the slides is on [Github](https://github.com/niklasjohannes/intro-ggplot2). A recording of the talk is on [Youtube]().
